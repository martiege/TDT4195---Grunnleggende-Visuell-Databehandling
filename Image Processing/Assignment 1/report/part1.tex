\section{Spatial Filtering}

\subsection{Task 1: Theory}
\subsubsection*{a)}
Sampling is the process of converting a continuos-time signal to a discrete-time signal, usually by measuring the continuos-time signal at specific points in time and extending this measurement over a set time step. 

\subsubsection*{b)}
Quantization is the process of constraining a signal from a larger to a smaller set of values, like mapping colours to the standard RGB range of 256 integer values. 

\subsubsection*{c)}
